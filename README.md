# Snake_Xenia
This is my first project on Github.
<br>Snake Xenia is a game which we played on touchpad phones in our childhood.
<br>With my first C++ project I tried to build it with basic usage of loops and functions in C++.
<br>So use it to play on your systems and try to get a good score..	&#57361;
